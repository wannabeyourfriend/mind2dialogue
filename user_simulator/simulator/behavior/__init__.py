"""Behavior library, selection, and block rendering.

The behavior subsystem provides persona-conditioned guidance that gets
injected into the user-simulator prompt at each turn. There are three
concerns:

  * library    — load YAML behaviors and the controller catalog
  * selection  — pick which behavior fires this turn (random or LLM)
  * block      — render the selected behavior into the XML guidance block
